### **The Social Distancing Monitor**
#### Using the Yolo model trained on the Coco dataset, we detect all the people in a frame and calculate the distance between them to determine whether people are maintaining social distancing or not.
The YOLO weights used can be accessed [here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights)
